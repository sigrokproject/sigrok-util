NAME
       sigrok-fwextract-kingst-la2016  -  Extract  Kingst firmware from vendor
       software

SYNOPSIS
       sigrok-fwextract-kingst-la2016 [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool extracts the FX2 MCU firmware and  FPGA  bitstreams  for  the
       Kingst  LA2016/LA1016  USB  logic  analyzers  from the vendor software.
       These analyzers share the  same  USB  VID:PID  and  use  the  same  FX2
       firmware.   The  correct  FPGA  bitstream  is selected by the libsigrok
       driver after loading the FX2 firmware and reading the device identifier
       from EEPROM.

       Download  the Linux version of the vendor software from [1], and unpack
       it to find the main binary called "KingstVIS". To extract the  firmware
       and bitstreams, run the following commands:

         $ tar -xzf KingstVIS_v3.5.0_linux.tar.gz KingstVIS

         $ sigrok-fwextract-kingst-la2016 KingstVIS/KingstVIS
         saved 178379 bytes to kingst-la1016a1-fpga.bitstream (crc32=166866be)
         saved 178151 bytes to kingst-la1016-fpga.bitstream (crc32=7db70001)
         saved 178362 bytes to kingst-la2016a1-fpga.bitstream (crc32=7cc894fa)
         saved 178542 bytes to kingst-la2016-fpga.bitstream (crc32=20694ff1)
         saved 5430 bytes to kingst-la-01a2.fw (crc32=720551a9)

       Copy  the above firmware and bitstream files to the location where lib-
       sigrok expects to find firmware files.  By  default  this  is  /usr/lo-
       cal/share/sigrok-firmware.

OPTIONS
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       Exits with 0 on success, 1 on most failures.
