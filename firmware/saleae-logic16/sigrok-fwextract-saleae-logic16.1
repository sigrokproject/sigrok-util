sigrok\-fwextract\-saleae\-logic16 \- Extract Saleae Logic16 firmware
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B sigrok\-fwextract\-saleae\-logic16 [FILE]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This tool extracts FX2 firmware and FPGA bitstreams from the vendor
software for the Saleae Logic16 USB logic analyzer. Download the Linux
version (either 32-bit or 64-bit will do), and unpack it to find the
main binary called "Logic".
.PP
In order to extract the firmware/bitstreams, run the following command:
.PP
.B "  $ sigrok-fwextract-saleae-logic16 Logic"
.br
.RB "  saved 5214 bytes to saleae-logic16-fx2.fw"

.br
.RB "  saved 149516 bytes to saleae-logic16-fpga-33.bitstream"
.PP
Copy the resulting files over to the location where libsigrok expects
to find its firmware files. By default this is
.BR /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware .
