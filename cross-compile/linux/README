This is a small script for cross-compiling sigrok and its dependencies
for Linux systems (various architectures / cross-toolchains).

It can also be used for native builds (this is actually the default) when
no cross-compiler setup is specified.


Status
------

Working.


Requirements
------------

 - bash
 - gcc
 - make
 - cmake
 - git
 - wget
 - unzip
 - pkg-config (>= 0.22)
 - autoconf
 - libtool
 - sdcc (needed for building the fx2lafw firmware)


Building
--------

 $ ./sigrok-cross-linux

Per default it will install the (cross-)compiled packages in:

 $HOME/sr

The main variables of interest are printed out before the build gets underway,
useful for visually validating the configuration.

Run the script with `-h` to see the main configuration options.

### Cross-build

To cross compile, pass the following environment variables to the script:
 * `TOOLCHAIN_PATH` : the path to the toolchain root that contains the `/bin/`
   directory with the toolchain executables.
 * `TOOLCHAIN_TRIPLET` : the cross compilation target triple

For example:
```sh
 $ TOOLCHAIN_PATH="/opt/toolchains/mytoolchain" TOOLCHAIN_TRIPLET="x86_64-linux-gnu" ./sigrok-cross-linux
```
