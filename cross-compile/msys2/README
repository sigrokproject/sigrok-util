This is a small script for compiling sigrok and its dependencies natively
on MSYS2/Windows systems.


Status
------

NOT fully working! This is work in progress.


Requirements
------------

See below for instructions on how to install the requirements.


Toolchain setup
---------------

First, you need to install MSYS2 (use the 64bit installer, msys2-x86_64-*.exe):

  https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/

Then, perform the MSYS2 update procedure as per the documentation above.

  $ update-core
    (If one of the packages is updated here, you MUST restart MSYS2)
  $ pacman -Su

Now close the shell and start an "MSYS2 MinGW32" shell (do NOT use the
"MSYS2 Shell", and do NOT use the "MSYS2 MinGW64" shell). All other
steps will always have to be performed in an "MSYS2 MinGW32" shell.

Install the MSYS2 git package there:

  $ pacman -Sy
  $ pacman -S git

This is all that is needed to bootstrap your MSYS2 system. You can now use
our sigrok-native-msys2 script to install all other required MSYS2 packages:

  $ ./sigrok-native-msys2 prepare


Building
--------

 $ ./sigrok-native-msys2

Per default it will install the compiled packages in:

 $HOME/sr_msys2

Please edit the script if you want to change any settings.
