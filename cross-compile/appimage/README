This is a small script for bundling PulseView and its dependencies
for Linux systems as an AppImage.

AppImage is a bundle format for Linux applications that allows the user to 
download an application, make it executable, and run.
No need to install. No system libraries or system preferences are altered.

For more information on AppImage, please see
http://appimage.org/

For example AppImages, please see

Status
------

Work in progress.


Requirements
------------

Currently the bundle.sh script uses pre-existing build products from Jenkins
that are built on Debian unstable. This makes the build product run on none
but the latest distributions. A much better choice would be to build e.g.,
on Debian oldstable, CentOS 6, or Ubuntu Trusty or earlier.
Examples for building bleeding-edge Qt4 and Qt5 applications on such mature
build systems can be found at
https://github.com/probonopd/AppImages/blob/master/recipes

The bundle.sh script has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 but is assumed
to also run on Debian unstable with no or minor changes. However, it is
strongly suggested to build and package the AppImage on a significantly
older distribution as mentioned above for any productive use.


Building
--------

 $ ./bundle.sh

Per default it will put the AppImage in:

 ./out/*.AppImage

Please edit the script if you want to change any settings.
